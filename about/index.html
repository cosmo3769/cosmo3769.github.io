Piyush was a part of the DeepFusionAI team where the project was to build a social distance detector that can run efficiently in near real-time on tiny devices such as mobile phones and Raspberry Pis. Throughout the tenure of WoC 2020, I found Piyush to be extremely hardworking and disciplined. He has a genuine hunger to improve his solutions and he pursues this endeavor quite fearlessly. Within a very short span of time, Piyush was able to create a clean PoC social distance detector abiding by all the constraints. He graciously incorporated all the feedback other mentors and I had suggested and he even further improved them.
Apart from his work, I also found Piyush to be a team player and overall a decent person to work with. I wish Piyush all the success in life and I am sure any team would be lucky to have a member like Piyush.</p></blockquote><h2 id=badges-i-proudly-endorse>Badges I Proudly Endorse</h2><ul><li><a href=https://developers.google.com/profile/badges/community/dsc/2021/lead>Google Developer Student Clubs NSEC Lead</a></li></ul></div></article><hr><div class=post-info></div></main></div><footer class=footer><div class=footer__inner><div class=footer__content><span>&copy; 2024</span>
