## Mentored Projects

#### **Self Supervised Learning Study**

Collaborated with an MLE in developing a streamlined pipeline to train model using self supervised algorithms. Used
[iNatualist-Aves dataset](https://github.com/cvl-umass/semi-inat-2020) for the purpose. Followed proper modular coding style. Used [WandB artifacts](https://wandb.ai/wandb_fc/ssl-study/artifacts/labelled-dataset/train/v0) to store and visulaize dataset. Used [WandB sweeps](https://wandb.ai/wandb_fc/ssl-study/sweeps?workspace=user-cosmo3769) to optimize hyperparameters. Used TensorFlow similarity model SimCLR.

#### **Real Time Social Distance Detector**

Built a real time social distance detector which is fast, accurate, and resource efficient, hence, can run on mobile devices. Used MobileDet model, an SSD (Single shot detector model) which is converted to TensforFlow Lite using TensorFlow
Object Detection API for on-device inference. Used calibration (bird’s eye view) and euclidean distance to measure proper distance between pedestrians.

#### **Quantized-LLMs**

Applied Post-Training Quantization techniques on LLM models. Compared quantized models with non-quantized models by benchmarking them. Ran inference with quantized models on mobile CPU (iOS) and benchmarked them.

* [Pushed Quantized models to HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/cosmo3769)

#### **[PDFChatter](https://pdf-chatter-beta.vercel.app)**

A locally running PDF chatbot where users can upload their documentation in pdf format and chat about it. It's a Next.js app that read the content of an uploaded PDF, chunks it, adds it to a vector store, and performs RAG, all client side. You can even turn off your WiFi after the site loads.
